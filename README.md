# OpenFiche

OpenFiche is a **post-AI search engine** designed to preserve **high-quality, human-generated content** - like a digital [microfiche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microform) for the web. The goal is to filter out AI slop, sponsored results, and paywalled clickbait in favor of trusted sources and distraction-free reading for academic research that requires verifiably accurate information.

## Inspiration

Modern search engines often produce frustrating experiences:

* Search results crowded with low-quality, AI-generated content and sponsored ads
* Articles locked behind paywalls or filled with intrusive advertisements
* Declining quality compared to the PageRank-driven era

OpenFiche aims to restore **clarity and trust in search**, especially for academic contexts, by surfacing **verified, human-written sources** and presenting them in a **streamlined reader interface**.
